    "Hearthstone also has very few cards in the \"Weapon\" class, around 50 or so in total. However, unlike the HERO cards, they are not so easily ignored. It is very possible that there was simply not enough data for the model to train on to accurately predict what would be a weapon card. As well, due to the characteristics they share with the MINION class, namely \"power\" and \"toughness\" (represented as \"durability\" for weapons in-game), it is likely that some, if not all of the weapons, were inadvertently classified as minions. As the game progresses and more cards are created, I would be interested to see how the addition of more weapons affects their classification.\n",

The precision of .69 for minions is interesting, and lends credence to two possible conclusions.
